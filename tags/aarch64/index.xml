Originally created by James Addyman as a part of OpenEMU to iOS for NES, SNES and Genesis systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project was eventually ported by myself to full Swift and protocol oriented design to more easily incorporate other open source emulator&amp;rsquo;s engines into our code base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got involved and eventually took over the project. We were the first team to deliver full performance Nintendo 64 emulation to iOS without jailbreaks that rely on JIY compilation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hero</title><link>https://joemattiello.dev/projects/creations/hero/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2018 12:41:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://joemattiello.dev/projects/creations/hero/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero">Hero Transitions&lt;/a> is an open source project that I voluneteered to take ownership of in 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project is also served as a &lt;a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Hero">Cocoapod&lt;/a>, the publishing of which is automated through GitHub actions I authored along with a suite of other CI/CD tools to assist with administrating such an important open-source project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project also support SwiftPM and Carthage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hero&lt;/strong> is a library for building iOS view controller transitions. It provides a declarative layer on top of the UIKit&amp;rsquo;s cumbersome transition APIsâ€”making custom transitions an easy task for developers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
