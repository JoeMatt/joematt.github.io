Originally created by James Addyman as a part of OpenEMU to iOS for NES, SNES and Genesis systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project was eventually ported by myself to full Swift and protocol oriented design to more easily incorporate other open source emulator&amp;rsquo;s engines into our code base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got involved and eventually took over the project. We were the first team to deliver full performance Nintendo 64 emulation to iOS without jailbreaks that rely on JIY compilation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
