<p>A collection of efforts to which I contributed, but did not create. Contributing back to Open Source projects is a strong passion of mine, and requires a considerate approach to learn norms, standards and approach for each community for a successful merge!</p>

#### Coming Soon!

There's so many to list, how can I fit them all.

Visit my GitHub profile for a partial list.

Notable exclusions

- `Core Audio` port of CoreAudio Objective-C & C libraries to Microsoft Xamarin
- `pbxbuild` for GNU/FSF OpenStep
