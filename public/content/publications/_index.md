### Event identification in sensor analytics

__Issued: Dec 31, 2013__
[_us 8620624B2_](https://patents.google.com/patent/U8620624B2/en)

#### Description

A method of detecting an event anomaly includes receiving one or more data points, in which each data point represents a spatial or temporal event; associating a unique identifier with each of the one or more data points to obtain one or more individualized data points; distributing the one or more individualized data points across a grid, in which the grid includes one or more cells; determining an event likelihood ratio for one or more of the grid cells; identifying one or more event clusters, in which each event cluster includes one or more of the grid cells; and storing in a data repository an event cluster having a significance level above a threshold significance level.

### System and Method of Performing Location Analytics

__Issued: Mar 3, 2012__
[_us 20120071175_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120071175/en)

#### Description

 A mobile terminal, a log information supplying method using the same, a detection system for a web platform, and a detection method using the same are provided to supply a detection result about the operation of a platform by obtaining log information regardless of the diverse platforms. CONSTITUTION: A log information manager(110) generates log data about state information of a web platform or web application executing information. A log message generator(150) generates a log message including a body and a header. A mobile communication terminal transmits the log message to a monitoring server.

### Anomaly Detection in Sensor Analytics

__Issued: Apr 1, 2010__
[_us 20100082301_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100082301/en)

#### Description

A method of detecting an event anomaly includes receiving one or more data points, in which each data point represents a spatial or temporal event, associating a unique identifier with each of the one or more data points to obtain one or more individualized data points, distributing the one or more individualized data points across a grid, in which the grid includes one or more cells, determining an event likelihood ratio for one or more of the grid cells, identifying one or more event clusters, in which each event cluster includes one or more of the grid cells, and storing in a data repository an event cluster having a significance level above a threshold significance level.

### Comparing Spatial-Temporal Trails In Location Analytics

__Issued: Apr 1, 2010__
[_us 20100079336_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100079336/en)

#### Description

Systems and computer implemented methods are provided for comparing, associating and deriving associations between two or more spatial temporal data trails. One or more spatial-temporal data trails comprising one or more places are received at a processor. Each place is identified by a spatial temporal data point. And each spatial-temporal data trail is associated with an individual. The similarity between pairs of places is determined to establish one or more groups of places or one or more groups of individuals. Similarity and/groups can be determined based on demographics associated with the place or individual.

### System and Method of Performing Location Analytics

__Issued: Dec 10, 2009__
[_us 20090307263_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090307263/en)

#### Description

A system and method are provided for associating location data from one or more unique sources. The place and time of a unique location enabled device are associated with stored demographic information relating to the particular place and particular time. The place and time of the unique location enabled device are associated with a historical record of past locations and time of locations that the device has been. Based on the association of demographical information and historical information, the unique location enable device is assigned to one or more groups or tribes. The location of all members of the group or tribe can be aggregated and exported for further analysis or display, thereby showing all group or tribe members at a particular time and place.
